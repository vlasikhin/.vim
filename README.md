2.Pull and link your fork with homesick:

```
  homesick clone https://github.com/vlasikhin/.vim.git
  homesick link .vim
```

3.Launch VIM (vim), ignore errors and call :PlugUpgrade (upgrades Plug manager to the latest version) and :PlugUpdate (updates/installs all the Plug-referenced plugins) commands. Plugins will be loaded on the next run. 
It might be a good idea to run those commands once in a while to keep your tools up-to-date
