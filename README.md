```
3.`cd .vim`

4.`cp .vimrc ~/`

5.`cp .vim/ ~/`

6.Launch VIM (vim), ignore errors and call `:PlugUpgrade` (upgrades Plug manager to the latest version) and `:PlugUpdate` (updates/installs all the Plug-referenced plugins) commands. Plugins will be loaded on the next run.
It might be a good idea to run those commands once in a while to keep your tools up-to-date
